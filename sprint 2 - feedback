a) Please fix the legend. There is overlapping text and is easy to miss in the beginning. 
The intearction is well implemented, however, I think having a small note before the visualization about 
how it works will be helpful for most users. 
b) The interaction is not smooth. Clicking on the visualization is a little bit confusing. 
For instance, clicking on the text produce in the orange box does not do anything, i have to click outside it. 
Would be great to look into it (or potentially have a hand icon, but you can ignore this if it is difficult to implement).
c) Think about what column 0 in the table means? 

Update: 10/10
We actually decided not to penalize people for these issues for sprint 2. 
Please account for these comments for the final deliverable. We will be checking if these are accounted for at that time.
