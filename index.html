    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p>For the past nine years, the Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts (SBN) has organized a Local Food &
      Specialty Crop Trade Show to facilitate connections between local producers and wholesale buyers. Encouraging
      buyer attendance is a key step in developing these relationships and helping small businesses integrate into a
      healthy, sustainable, local economy. After interviewing a representative from SBN, it became clear that a visual
      representation of vendor attendees was the solution to increasing buyer attendance at the trade show. We learned
      that their strategy is to market the experience, opening up the festival to more food producers and consumers. In
      doing so, the organization noted the concerns and barriers that buyers face, including production capacities and
      certifications, such as organic and GAP certification and focus on heirloom varieties or heritage breeds.
      Visualizations have been created specifically for buyers to explore what types of attending vendors meet their
      needs. Other attendees, vendors, and planners of the SBN trade show would also be able to use this tool to
      visualize representation at the event.</p>

    <p>Based on the interview, SBN needed a visualization that would help buyers understand if the trade show has what
      they are looking for. This led us to a few guiding questions: How do we show potential buyers what vendors are
      present? How do we visualize information about vendors? Specifically, what can we do to represent the capacities
      and certifications of the vendors, two key factors that determine vendor-buyer connections?</p>

    <h1>Visualization</h1>

    <p>Interact with the treemap below to see which vendors will be attending SBN’s Local Food Trade Show. Hover your
      mouse over the cells to show more information, like the total number of vendors within a category. Click on the
      cells to filter the table below so that it only shows the vendors within that category—you can select and unselect
      multiple cells to apply different table filters.</p>

    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

    <p>Specialty crop vendor information is represented by two major visualizations: a treemap and a table.
      Design aspects for both are described in the sections below.</p>

    <h2>Treemap</h2>

    <p>Our visualization aims to display trade show vendor attendees, grouped by subcategories, in a
      hierarchical format. The standard treemap view is depicted below.</p>

    <p><img src="images/vis_explanation/treemap.PNG" width="600"></p>
    <p>&emsp;Figure 1. Treemap, legend, and tooltip representing vendor information.</p>

    <p>The treemap here serves as a categorization of vendors who go to the SBN trade show. Vendors listed in the
      table are represented in the grouped treemap cells; the area of each cell depicts how many vendors fall into
      a specified category. Using area to represent groups allows for the relative size of different subgroups to
      be directly compared. This data is currently nested by "Business Type" followed by "Product Category." A
      legend depicts which colors correspond to each business type; these colors were chosen to go along with food/crop
      colors that are commonly associated with fresh crops and farmers markets. For details on demand, hovering over a
      treemap cell displays all information for that cell within a tooltip: business type, product type, and total
      number of vendors. This prevents the treemap cells from showing too much text at once if it is not desired. The
      presence of the tooltip also indicates when a cell can be clicked.</p>

    <h2>Table</h2>

    <p>The same vendors are also represented in a table, this time showing more information. This table is shown in the
      figure below. </p>

    <p><img src="images/vis_explanation/table.PNG" width="600"></p>
    <p>&emsp;Figure 2. Table representing detailed vendor information.</p>

    <p>We have implemented a scrollable table to display the 34 specialty crop vendors that we have data for. Including
      all of these subcategories in the treemap would have shown too much information, so instead the user has the
      option to identify their categories of interest before looking for more information. The “Vendor Name” column with
      ID numbers is representative of a possible addition that SBN could make to the data. We did not have the names of
      individual vendors, so we chose to assign values to each business. This table includes all useful information that
      could entice a seller into attending the Trade Show, including farm type, product offerings, production practices,
      and volume capabilities of each vendor.</p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>

    <p>Mouseover and on-click events show details-on-demand and link the treemap and table. This is represented by the
      figure below.</p>

    <p><img src="images/vis_explanation/interaction.PNG" width="600"></p>
    <p>&emsp;Figure 3. On-click linking between the treemap and table.</p>

    <p>The above images are an example of how the treemap and table would behave if the “Specialty Crop Value-Added
      Producer (50% or more specialty crop), Value-Added Products” treemap cell were to be clicked. The treemap and
      table are also interactive and linked to one another. Clicking on treemap cells filters the table so that only the
      vendors that fall within that category are shown. Clicking additional cells adds them to the filter, and clicking
      on already-selected cells removes them from the filter. A lower opacity cell color indicates if a cell is
      currently clicked.</p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p>There were three separate datasets provided to us from SBN. One CSV contained information about the buyers. Two
      CSVs contained data from the vendors, separated by whether the vendor had specialty items. Our project focused on
      the specialty vendor data. This dataset contained 20 fields and 34 entries. The fields included categorical values
      like position of the person filling out the application, the type of business, certifications/special practices,
      and types of products and crops; ordinal values like the volume produced and the volume of capacity to sell to new
      accounts; and continuous quantitative values like percent of products sold to wholesale and goal percent of
      products sold to wholesale. Only values representing business and product types, certifications, and volumes were
      kept for the visualization.</p>

    <p>Once we decided on the principal visualization we were creating, a treemap, we added additional fields to
      aggregate and/or summarize certain fields. Specifically, we categorized the crops and products into “Plants,”
      “Produce,” and “Value-Added Products,” combinations of those categories, and “Other.” Only the most common
      combinations were kept as their own categories, and the less common combinations were grouped into the “Other”
      category. For example, “Produce and Value-Added Products” had enough instances to be represented as its own
      category, but “Produce and Plants” did not, so it was grouped into “Other.” Similarly, we limited the number of
      different values in the certifications field. We categorized items if they had multiple certifications, and
      otherwise kept other values including singular certifications, “Other”, and “Not Applicable.” We needed to add
      these two fields to avoid excessively small areas in our treemap resulting from the various combinations of
      products and certifications. We also wanted to aggregate the data from the capacities that vendors were willing to
      take on from new buyers. Instead of having each season be a level within the hierarchy, we made an aggregate field
      that showed the max amount a vendor was capable of within a season. Another change from the provided data was a
      few of the column names; this would remove information that the average user does not need access to.</p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Sustainable Business Network is looking for a visualization that will give suppliers and buyers an idea of
      whether they want to take part in the trade show. Summarizing and presenting the registration data will encourage
      trade show attendance by informing attendees about vendors. The primary consumer of the visualization would be
      those who are thinking about attending the trade show. SBN wants to attract more buyers by visualizing the vendor
      information.</p>

    <p>Before we decided the specific visualization we were creating, we looked at the various potential tasks. The most
      important domain task was to categorize vendors by types of food they produce, the size of their farm, and the
      certifications they have. To do this, we have summarized the data as the analytical task, allow for the user to
      browse the data as the search task, and present this in our tree-map and linked table as the analyze task. The
      completion of this task would also aid in the goals of our second domain task: analyzing what types of vendors
      were unrepresented and what foods buyers were looking for. The goals of this task were to identify the categories
      and to provide the user capabilities to locate and derive information from what is missing. Because this
      information isn’t explicitly given to us, the process for addressing this domain task was based more on what isn’t
      shown in the visualization. A vendor can look at the visualization and realize that nobody else currently in the
      trade show hits the same niche. This can make a vendor more inclined to apply next year.</p>

    <p>We had two other domain tasks that did not get represented by our visualization due to our focus on vendors. One
      task was to classify buyers by consumption (quantity and type). To do this we would need to summarize the data,
      provide browsing ability, and present this in our visualization. A third task was to visualize the location of
      vendors. This required comparing the values, providing browsing ability, and presenting this in our visualization.
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p>Our design process was split into these major iterations - a tableau Exploration, hand drawn sketches of our
      visualization, and a digitally sketched visualization with a lot of detail, usability testing and editing our
      visualization, and then the final visualization.</p>

    <p>Before we were fully accustomed to our data and the project, we were tasked with combing through our data in
      Tableau to gain a further understanding of our data. Here we created several types of visualizations to try to
      fulfill the tasks we created in our task analysis section. We mostly created simple visualizations such as bar
      charts which plotted businesses to the amount of food they can provide, or a table showing business types.</p>

    <p>The second iteration of sketches were hand drawn, as shown in the figure below. During this iteration, more of an
      emphasis was placed on creating a visualization with proper design choices that we learned in class.</p>

    <p><img src="images/design_process/sketch.PNG" width="600"></p>
    <p>&emsp;Figure 4. Hand drawn sketch of visualization.</p>

    <p>The third iteration of our visualization was a digitally sketched version using a combination of figma, tableau,
      and excel with a detailed explanation of how we expect our visualization to work. During this section, we created
      the specific filters (such as food category, farm category, pallet capacity, etc.) that our visualization would
      have as well as how brushing and linking would change the view of our visualization step-by-step. To see more
      specifications, look at figure 2 in the visualization section.</p>

    <p><img src="images/design_process/final.PNG" width="600"></p>
    <p>&emsp;Figure 5. Digitally-created final design sketch.</p>

    <p>Our next versions of our visualizations were created by coding it through Javascript. For the most part, we were
      able to bring to life our sketches, but we had some difficulty implementing interactivity and brushing and
      linking. After the fourth version, we conducted a usability test in class, and realized that our visualization was
      neither as clear nor as easy to use as we anticipated. Several key takeaways we took away was that we needed to
      make it easier for people unfamiliar with the data understand the data better (we did this by creating
      understandable category names, adding a legend, changing text in our data to be more concise, and getting rid of
      unimportant data), we needed to make the visualization look better (we eventually made the treemap and
      corresponding table smaller so that it was easier on the eye), and we needed to improve our brushing and linking
      (we did this by having a tooltip that that hovers over the tree map, and adding additional linking to our treemap
      and table). This final point was also brought up in course staff feedback to our Sprint 1 implementation. At the
      time, our tooltip only appeared below the treemap, making it easy to miss. It was later fixed to follow the user’s
      cursor and appear on mouseover events.</p>

    <p>The final visualization design incorporated feedback from Sprint 2 implementation as well as changes following
      Sprint 1. These changes focused on improving design clarity and interactivity. To make the design clearer, the
      legend was placed next to the treemap instead of below, and the text was reformatted to avoid overlaps. A short
      note was also added above the treemap to prompt user interaction. Table information was improved by changing
      column header, such as replacing “0” with “Vendor Name,” to ensure that it accurately described the data.
      Interactivity was improved by adding to the existing mouseover and on-click events. Now, the user can hover and
      click on treemap cell labels to enable the tooltip and table filters, while previously these interactions only
      worked on cell areas outside of the text.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>We applied information visualization principles and implemented several iterations of our design to create this
      interactive treemap-table for our partner, SBN. This process included interviewing a partner, understanding the
      problem at hand, brainstorming how to solve the problem, receiving a dataset, exploring a dataset, creating
      several mock sketches, completing several digitally coded versions as well going through usability test, and then
      eventually presenting our project to our instructors and partners. For future iterations, it would be helpful to
      conduct usability testing with SBN and intended users of the visualization. We received a lot of insight from the
      in-class usability session, but it would be more beneficial to conduct it on a more finalized design. Another
      future goal of the project would be implementing the user chosen treemap (the hand-drawn sketch in the previous
      section) where the user decides the treemap hierarchy. Due to the complexity of a treemap visualization and
      nesting JSON data, this goal was not attainable in the amount of time that we had. With additional time, we also
      would have explored d3’s nesting feature more heavily.</p>

    <p>Overall, our group did the best we could considering the constraints we had—learning a new programming language,
      figuring out how to handle working remotely—to go through the visualization design process from start to finish.
      We look forward to applying the concepts and skills we have gained from this process to our own projects in the
      future.</p>
