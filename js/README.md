# Put the JavaScript code you write in this folder

This folder contains the javascript code written to make the table, treemap, and interactive combination of the two that shows up on the webpage. 

## For future additions
We recommend you separate the implementation details for individual visualizations using the [Reusable Charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) framework Mike Bostock advocates.
Broadly this means implementing visualizations as closures with getter-setter methods.
This can be further extended to [making updatable charts](https://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts).
