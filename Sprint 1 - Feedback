8/10 
-2 for no interaction implemented 

Update: 4/12/2020 - Detailed feedback
we were expecting a little more sophistication on the type of interaction implemented. 
Given that sprint 1 was an important check point in the project and used for usability testing, 
we would have expected to see progress in implementing one of the brushing and 
linking interactions (or equivalent in your case). The grading for this assignment was a 
little tough in order to ensure students are on track for the subsequent iterations of the project.
We gave a perfect grade only for non-buggy interactions in that respect, with no obvious usability issues. 
For instance, you have a lot of overlapping text in the tree-map itself.  


Update: 
10/10 
- We have actually decided to not deduct points unless the interactivity is completely broken, so please take those comments
into account for the final deliverable. We will be checking for these at that time and penalize then.
